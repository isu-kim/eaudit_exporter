Both of these scripts are used to run comparative measurements 
for other systems (provbpf, sysdig, auditd). They are "delayed"
versions of the postmark/shbm benchmarks, meaning that one can insert
sleep signals perioically as the benchmark runs. This mechanism
decreases the system call rate of the benchmark compared to if it was
run without these sleeps. Look at the usage
information to run them correctly. You must set the SLEEPTIME
environment variable (export SLEEPTIME=1, for example) if you want 
to actually insert the sleeps into these benchmarks before running
them.
