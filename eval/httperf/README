httperf (https://github.com/httperf/httperf) is a performance evaluation tool
for web servers. For this measurement, it creates a large number of requests to
the web server. This script wraps the functionality of httperf so that it
requires only three parameters: the number of http connections, the rate at
which HTTP requests are made, and the number of concurrent http clients. The
first two parameters determine the system call rate of the
benchmark on a single core. The last parameter controls the number of httperf
processes that will run in parallel. To run httperf, one must do the following:

-- Install the following dependencies with apt: nginx, httperf
-- Configure nginx to serve static content.
-- Download content referenced in uris.txt from 
   http://seclab.cs.sunysb.edu/seclab/pubs/ or modify uris.txt to specify the
   content you want to download and get fetched.
