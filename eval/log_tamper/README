lt_eaudit --> Measures the log tampering window of eAudit. For info
on how to run it, look at the usage documentation produced
by the script. Be aware that the script does not produce signals
to eAudit to generate log tamper windows at runtime, contrary
to the paper. The script will generate 4 important fields:
the number of windows generated, avg. # of normal syscalls.
avg. # of important syscalls, and avg. # of critical syscalls.

lt_sysdig --> Measures the log tampering window of sysdig-capture.
Instructions:

1. Run sysdig-capture. Wait 5 or so seconds for it to calm down.
2. Open a new terminal. As sysdig-capture is running, run lt_sysdig. 
You must run the benchmark you want to run from inside the script. 
Make sure it is a benchmark that runs at least 10 seconds long.
3. Wait for the lt_sysdig script to complete. It will print a variable
called buffer_ratio. Stop sysdig-capture. 
4. Use buffer_ratio value as a parameter to run the count_recs
script. It will print the tamper window size.
