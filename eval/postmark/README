This directory contains the original postmark benchmark, as well as a version
we modified to insert delays. The top-level script is runpm, which can run
one or more instances of postmark in parallel. Each instance will use a 
dedicated subdirectory to operate, as this allows for increased parallelism.
The size of the workload and other details are specified in the config files
that are named pm-config.{nano,micro,sm,reg}. The suffixes are indicative of
the length of time that the benchmark will take to complete.

Note that postmark with delays introduced is meant for serial rather than
parallel operation, and is not supported by runpm. This is because that version
is intended for evaluating audit collection systems that are unable to cope
with even a single instance of postmark.

Before running the scripts, you need to compile using the makefile. Note that
postmark uses a very old dialect of C, and will hence produce many warning
messages.
