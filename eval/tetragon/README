This directory contains yaml-based policy files that filter for ebpf 
tracepoint-based syscall events recorded by tetragon. 
Each file is named {benchmark}_syscall.yaml (with the exception 
of all_calls.yaml, which is only used for testing purposes)
and the syscalls predominantly produced by those benchmarks (about the top 80%
of syscalls) correspond to their respective policy files. Follow 
the documentation on the Tetragon website if you wish to learn 
how to apply these policy files at runtime. Tetragon's log file 
default location is /var/log/tetragon/tetragon.log, but this 
can be changed from the Tetragon configuration at one's discretion.
